Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Investigate relationships between smoking and key variables.
Employ scatter plots, bar charts, and box plots for exploration.
Statistical Analysis:
Conduct statistical tests to explore associations.
Identify significant predictors influencing smoking behavior.
Logistic Regression Model:
Build and evaluate a logistic regression model.
Uncover insights into factors contributing to smoking.
Random Forest Model:
Implement a Random Forest model for enhanced predictive accuracy.
Evaluate and compare performance with logistic regression.
Model Evaluation Metrics:
